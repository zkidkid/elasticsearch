== Overview

Official low-level client for Elasticsearch. Allows to communicate with an
Elasticsearch cluster through http. Compatible with all elasticsearch versions.

=== Features

The low-level client's features include:

* minimal dependencies

* load balancing across all available nodes

* failover in case of node failures and upon specific response codes

* failed connection penalization (whether a failed node is retried depends on
 how many consecutive times it failed; the more failed attempts the longer the
 client will wait before trying that same node again)

* persistent connections

* trace logging of requests and responses

* optional automatic <<sniffer,discovery of cluster nodes>>
