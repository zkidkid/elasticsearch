== Percolator

deprecated[5.0.0,Percolate and multi percolate APIs are deprecated and have been replaced by the new <<query-dsl-percolate-query,`percolate` query>>]

added[5.0.0,Percolate query modifications only become visible after a refresh has occurred. Previously, they became visible immediately]

added[5.0.0,For indices created on or after version 5.0.0-alpha1 the percolator automatically indexes the query terms with the percolator queries. This allows the percolator to percolate documents more quickly. It is advisable to reindex any pre 5.0.0 indices to take advantage of this new optimization]
