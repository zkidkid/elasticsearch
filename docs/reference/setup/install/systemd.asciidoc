==== Running Elasticsearch with `systemd`

To configure Elasticsearch to start automatically when the system boots up,
run the following commands:

[source,sh]
--------------------------------------------------
sudo /bin/systemctl daemon-reload
sudo /bin/systemctl enable elasticsearch.service
--------------------------------------------------

Elasticsearch can be started and stopped as follows:

[source,sh]
--------------------------------------------
sudo systemctl start elasticsearch.service
sudo systemctl stop elasticsearch.service
--------------------------------------------

These commands provide no feedback as to whether Elasticsearch was started
successfully or not.  Instead, this information will be written to the
`systemd` journal, which can be tailed as follows:

[source,sh]
--------------------------------------------
sudo journalctl -f
--------------------------------------------

Log files can be found in `/var/log/elasticsearch/`.
