=== HTTP changes

==== Compressed HTTP requests are always accepted

Before 5.0, Elasticsearch accepted compressed HTTP requests only if the setting
 `http.compressed` was set to `true`. Elasticsearch accepts compressed requests
 now but will continue to send compressed responses only if `http.compressed`
 is set to `true`.
