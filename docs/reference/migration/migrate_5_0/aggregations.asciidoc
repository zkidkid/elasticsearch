=== Aggregation changes

==== Significant terms on numeric fields

Numeric fields have been refactored to use a different data structure that
performs better for range queries. However, since this data structure does
not record document frequencies, numeric fields need to fall back to running
queries in order to estimate the number of matching documents in the
background set, which may incur a performance degradation.

It is recommended to use <<keyword,`keyword`>> fields instead, either directly
or through a <<multi-fields,multi-field>> if the numeric representation is
still needed for sorting, range queries or numeric aggregations like
<<search-aggregations-metrics-stats-aggregation,`stats` aggregations>>.

==== `ip_range` aggregations

Now that Elasticsearch supports `ipv6`, `ip` addresses are encoded in the index
using a binary representation rather than a numeric representation. As a
consequence, the output of `ip_range` aggregations does not give numeric values
for `from` and `to` anymore.

==== `size: 0` on Terms, Significant Terms and Geohash Grid Aggregations

`size: 0` is no longer valid for the terms, significant terms and geohash grid
aggregations. Instead a size should be explicitly specified with a number greater
than zero.

==== Fractional time values

Fractional time values (e.g., 0.5s) are no longer supported. For example, this means when setting
date histogram intervals "1.5h" will be rejected and should instead be input as "90m".
