=== `_field_names` field

The `_field_names` field indexes the names of every field in a document that
contains any value other than `null`.  This field is used by the
<<query-dsl-exists-query,`exists`>> query to find documents that
either have or don't have any non-+null+ value for a particular field.

The value of the `_field_name` field is accessible in queries and scripts:

[source,js]
--------------------------
# Example documents
PUT my_index/my_type/1
{
  "title": "This is a document"
}

PUT my_index/my_type/1
{
  "title": "This is another document",
  "body": "This document has a body"
}

GET my_index/_search
{
  "query": {
    "terms": {
      "_field_names": [ "title" ] <1>
    }
  },
  "script_fields": {
    "Field names": {
      "script": {
        "lang": "painless",
        "inline": "doc['_field_names']" <2>
      }
    }
  }
}
