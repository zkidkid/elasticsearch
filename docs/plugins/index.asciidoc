== Introduction to plugins

Plugins are a way to enhance the core Elasticsearch functionality in a custom
manner. They range from adding custom mapping types, custom analyzers, native
scripts, custom discovery and more.

Plugins contain JAR files, but may also contain scripts and config files, and
must be installed on every node in the cluster.  After installation, each
node must be restarted before the plugin becomes visible.

IMPORTANT: Site plugins -- plugins containing HTML, CSS and Javascript -- are
no longer supported.

For advice on writing your own plugin, see <<plugin-authors>>.
